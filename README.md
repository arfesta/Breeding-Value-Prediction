## Abstract

* Phenotypic variation in forest trees may be partitioned into genomic and environmntal compenets which are consequently used to estimate the heritability of traits as the proportion of total phenotypic variation attributed to genetic variation.

* Applied tree breeding programs can use matrices of relationships, based either on recorded pedigrees in structured breeding populations or on genotypes of molecular genetic markers, to model genetic covariation among related individuals and predict genetic values for individuals for whom no phenotypic measurements are available. 

* ***This study tests the hypothesis that genetic covariation among individuals of similar genetic value will be reflected in shared patterns of gene expression.*** We collected gene expression data by high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated from pooled seedlings of parents with known genetic value, and compared alternative approaches to data analysis to test this hypothesis.

## Background of samples

* LGEP
   
   - 144 Biological Replicates x 3 technical replicates = 432 technical replicates

* EW

   - 80 Biological Replicates x 3 technical replicates = 240 technical replicates

## Analyses

### Step 1 - Data Prep

   Data prep includes everything from unpacking the original tar files recieved by the GSL up to estimating transcript               
      abundance with Salmon. Additionally, this step includes identification of the indicies used within both batches and creates an experimental info matrix containing all meta data from both batches.
      
   See the [raw reads README](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/arfesta/Breeding-Value-Prediction/blob/master/disk6directory/rawreads/012718raw_data_processing.html) for step by step processing of files.

### Step 2 - Load Count Data
      
   Once counts have been estimated, the next step involves reading in the aligned technical, or biological, replicate counts using the tximport package.
      
   Additionally, the phenotype and other sample meta-data is constructed for normalization.

   To see this process for **technical reps**, navigate to: [load counts tech rep html file](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/arfesta/Breeding-Value-Prediction/blob/master/disk6directory/analyses/step2.loadcounts/load.counts_techreps.html) which contains the complete markdown and output.

### Step 3 - Normalization

The counts were normarlized *two* ways:

  1.  Using **techincal replicate** counts and asreml to normalize for batch, index, lane, and pedigree
  
  2.  Using **bioloigcal replicate** counts and DESeq2 to normalize for batch and index.  This method also incorporates the offest generated by Salmon.
  

### Step 4 - Filtering

   Counts returned post-normalization are then applied to X different filters.
