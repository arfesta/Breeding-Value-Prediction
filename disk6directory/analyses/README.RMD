# ANALYSES

## Step 1 - Data Prep
   
   [See markdown of data steps](../rawreads/README.md)

    * The first step involves reading in the aligned technical replicate counts using the tximport package.
      
      Additionally, the phenotype and other sample meta-data is constructed for normalization
    
## Step 2 - Normalization

    * The counts may be normalized using the sommer package and account for lane, index, and pedigree if 
    
      using the 576 techincal replicates. Output can be family or biological level log2 sample counts.

## Step 3 - Filtering

     * Counts returned post-normalization are then applied to X different filters. ***
