# ANALYSES

## Step 1 - Data Prep
   
      The data prep step includes everything from unpacking the tar files recieved by the GSL to estimating transcript               
      abundance with Salmon
   
   See the [raw reads readme](../rawreads/README.md) for step by step processing of files.  

## Step 2 - Load Count Data
      
      Once counts have been estimated, the next step involves reading in the aligned technical, or biological replicate counts using the tximport package.
      
      Additionally, the phenotype and other sample meta-data is constructed for normalization

## Step 3 - Normalization

    * The counts may be normalized using the sommer package and account for lane, index, and pedigree if 
    
      using the 576 techincal replicates. Output can be family or biological level log2 sample counts.

## Step 4 - Filtering

     * Counts returned post-normalization are then applied to X different filters. ***
